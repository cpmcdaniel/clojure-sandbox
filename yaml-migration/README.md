# yaml-migration

A Clojure utility designed to allow migration from one YAML config file version to a newer version. The newer version may have new options and may have removed old ones which are now obsolete. This implementation has been made with the following assumptions and limitations:

1. The new file is assumed to be a sample contain all valid options with reasonable default values for the latest version of the configuration.
2. If an option exists in both files, the old value will be kept in the output.
3. If an option has been removed, it will be commented out at the bottom of the output.
4. If a new option has been added, it will be included in the output with its default value from the new file.
5. Comments, ordering, and other formatting is not currently preserved.
6. Does not currently handle deeply-nested changes (untested!).

## Usage

There are a few ways to execute this code.

### At the REPL

You can use _lein repl_ in the root of the project to run the code interactively. The file paths are relative to the project root.

```clojure
(use 'yaml-migration.migrate)
(migrate-yaml "resources/file1.yaml" "resources/file2.yaml" "target/out.yaml")
```

### From the command line with lein

Alternatively, you can execute it from the command line with _lein run_.

```
$ lein run -m yaml-migration.migrate resources/file1.yaml resources/file2.yaml target/out.yaml
```

### From the command line with a JAR

Finally, you could package everything up using _lein uberjar_ and run it like so:

```
$ java -jar target/yaml-migration-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar \
resources/file1.yaml resources/file2.yaml target/out.yaml
```
